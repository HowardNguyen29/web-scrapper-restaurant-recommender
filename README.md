# web-scrapper and restaurant recommender

These days, with the rise of online reviews and the abundance of dining options, individuals often find themselves overwhelmed when choosing a restaurant. To address this challenge, I propose a project focused on web scraping review data on Yelp and developing a restaurant recommender system. By extracting insights from online reviews, this system aims to provide personalized restaurant recommendations based on individual preferences and past dining experiences. This innovative solution seeks to simplify the dining decision-making process for users, enhancing their overall dining experiences while saving time and effort in selecting the perfect restaurant.
